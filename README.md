# https-atlas
######(aka https-most-places)

This is my version of https-everywhere in pure javascript, without using xml
rules files.

##The goals are:
* Stable Chrome Build
* Lighter (aiming for <30kb for https-atlas vs 240kb for https-everywhere)
* Easier for users to suggest sites

##Note
Stuff in /alpha is pretty much on fire. Don't use it for anything of consequence.

## Questions, queries, queaths?
