# https-atlas
#######aka https-most-places

This is my version of https-everywhere in pure javascript, without using xml
rules files.

##The goals are:
* Stable Chrome Build
* Lighter (aiming for <30kb for https-atlas vs 240kb for https-everywhere)
* Easier for users to add/remove sites

## Questions, queries, queaths?
